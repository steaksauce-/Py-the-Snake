# Py-the-Snake
A simple snake-style game written in Python

This project started as a simple learning Python project using Udemy.
You can enroll in the same course that got me the majority of the initial upload [here](https://www.udemy.com/python-game-development-creating-a-snake-game-from-scratch/)

Items on the TODO list as of 07/31/2017 are a result of challenges from the instructor or desires (such is the case with the Python logos for food)

Feel free to contribute to this project, but PLEASE:
***beginners only!***

Current TODO:
 Play, Quit, Settings menu
 In settings menu, enable/disable sound, set difficulty
 Use python logo for food image
 Add sounds
 Log high score
 Installer

 Possibly turn game into code-based instructions???
